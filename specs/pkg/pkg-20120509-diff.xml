         <p>This proposal defines a packaging system for various core XML technologies: XSLT,
            XQuery, and XProc. The goal is to define it in a way generic enough so to adapt it to
            other technologies in the future (such as XML Schema, XForms, etc.) using the same
            framework. Besides enabling the delivery of libraries written in standard XSLT, XQuery
            and XProc, it provides support for extensions specific to some processors, as well as
            enabling new processors to be supported by using the same framework.</p>

         <head>Introduction</head>
         <p>XSLT, XQuery and XProc are amazing programming languages. But they lack a large choice
            of libraries, and when such libraries do exist, this is a challenge to install. There is
            no automatic install process, the rules are different for each processor, library
            authors do not follow the same rules regarding the info they provide, the cataloging,
            the way they reference third-party libraries, etc.</p>
         <p>All those problems (well, most of them) can be addressed by a packaging system that
            is broadly adopted by processor vendors and library authors. The cornerstone of
            such a system is the packaging format: a description of the information to be provided
            by the library authors and how to provide and structure them.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 id="concepts">
         <head>Concepts</head>
         <p>A <kw>package</kw> is a set of files fulfilling a common purpose. A package could for
            instance provide XML schemas for a particular document type, alongside a set of XSLT
            stylesheets to format the same document type to HTML or XSL-FO. Or a package can simply
            provide an XQuery library module containing a set of functions (directly supporting the
            notion of <emph>library</emph>). Those files composing a package (stylesheets, schemas,
            pipelines, queries, etc.) are called its <kw>components</kw>.</p>
         <p>A package has a unique name (a URI) as well as a convenient short name, also known as
            its <kw>abbrev</kw> (an NCName), used in contexts where a URI is not suitable (or simply
            not convenient) and where the uniqueness of the name is not necessary. A package has a
            set of dependencies too. A dependency is another package, identified by its full name, a
            package depends on.</p>
         <p>A package provides all those infos as well as its components as a single file. This is
            then very convenient to organize packages, publish them, give them to a processor to
            install them, etc.</p>
         <p>A <kw>component</kw> can be of one out of several types: an XSLT stylesheet, <phrase
               diff="del">an XML schema, a RELAX NG schema, an XProc pipeline, but also any other
               type a particular implementation chose to support. It is identified by a <kw>public
                  URI</kw>.</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add">an XQuery main or library module, an XProc pipeline, an XML schema, a
               RELAX NG schema (XML or compact syntax), a Schematron schema, an NVDL schema, or a
               plain resource file. An implementation can add support for additional types. A
               component is identified by a <kw>public URI</kw>.</phrase> This public URI is used to
            access the component from the outside of the package. Each component type has its own
               <kw>URI space</kw>, within which a component's URI has to be unique (so two different
            components can have the same public URI if they are of different types, but this is not
            recommended).</p>
         <p>All the components composing the package, alongside an additional <kw>package
               descriptor</kw>, are used to create a ZIP file. This file <emph>is</emph> the
            physical package, and can be used to distribute the package to the users. The package
            descriptor is a plain XML file, named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> at the root of the ZIP
            file, and containing information about the package (like its name and its version
            number) and about the components it provides and how to reference them.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 id="descriptor">
         <head>Package descriptor</head>
         <p>The package descriptor is an XML file, named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> and located at
            the root of the ZIP file. It describe the whole package, and all of its components.
            Alongside this descriptor, the root of the ZIP file contains a directory named <phrase
               diff="del">after the module abbrev, which contains</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add"><code>content</code>, containing</phrase> the components and any
            other file the package needs. All the relative URIs used to identify components are
            relative to the <phrase diff="del">package</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add">content</phrase> directory. See <specref ref="expath-pkg.xsd"/> for a
            normative schema.</p>
         <note>
            <p>Because this package format is designed to be extensible and used as a building block
               by other specifications, the ZIP file can contain another entries at top-level. They
               are just ignored when the package is deployed as a simple package following this
               specification.</p>
         </note>
         <div2 id="structure">
            <head>Overall structure</head>
            <p>All the elements in the package descriptor are defined in the namespace
                  <code>http://expath.org/ns/pkg</code>. All the elements defined in this
               specification or used in samples and in text are in this namespace, even if no prefix
               is used. The root element is <code>package</code>, and contains, besides some naming
               and versionning attributes, a title, an optional home URI, an optional list of
               dependencies on other packages and on processors, and a list of components:</p>
            <eg>
&lt;package name = uri
         abbrev = string
         version = string
         spec = string>
   title,
   home?,
   dependency*,
   (xslt
   |xquery
   |xproc
   |xsd
   |rng
   |rnc)*
&lt;/package></eg>
            <p><code>name</code> is the name of the package. A package is named using an <phrase
                  diff="del">absolute URI, except any <code>file:</code> scheme URIs</phrase>
               <phrase diff="add">IRI, as defined by <bibref ref="rfc3987"/>, excepted any IRI using
                  the <code>file:</code> scheme</phrase> (most frequent choices are
                  <code>http:</code> and <code>urn:</code> scheme URIs). <phrase diff="add">Note
                  that the definition of IRI excludes relative references.</phrase>
               <code>abbrev</code> is the package abbrev, and <code>version</code> its version.
                  <phrase diff="del">The package directory must have the exact same name as the
                  abbrev.</phrase>
               <code>spec</code> is the version of the packaging specification the package conforms
               to. The current specification requires the package to use the spec number
                  <code>1.0</code> (no forward compatibility rules are defined, a processor
               conforming to this specification has to generate an error if the spec number is
               different than the string <code>1.0</code>). The package then contains a title, which
               is a plain string, intended to be a simple description of the package for humans, and
               a home which is a URI to find more informations about the package. It then contains
               the list of its dependencies and the list of its components.</p>
            <eg>
&lt;dependency package = uri
            processor = string
            versions = string
            semver = string
            semver-min = string
            semver-max = string>
   <emph>empty</emph>
&lt;/dependency></eg>
            <p>Dependencies are set by using the name of other packages this package depends on. The
               dependency can also define the version of the package or the set of processors it
               depends on by using one of the few available strategies; see <specref
                  ref="versioning"/> for a complete description of them.</p>

            <p>This section describes the standard component kinds supported by this specification,
               and how they contribute to the package descriptor document type. <phrase diff="add"
                  >Every component has the same basic information: it associates a public URI to a

               <p>An XQuery library module is referenced by its namespace URI. Thus the

                  importing module just need to use an import statement of the form <code>import
                     module namespace xx = "&lt;namespace-uri>";</code>.</p>
               <p>An XQuery main module is associated a public URI. Usually an XQuery package will
                  provide functions through library modules, but in some cases one can want to

               <p>Note that there is no way to set any location hint (as the <code>at</code> clause
                  in the import statement.) To use this packaging system, an XQuery library module

         <note diff="add">
            <p>This section is deprecated, either to remove it completely or to rewrite it (in case
               some pieces should be kept here). Most of this material should be moved to the new
               section "URI resolving").</p>
         </note>
         <p>A <kw>processor</kw> is any program that use packaged components. For instance, an XSLT
            processor uses XSLT stylesheets (as well as XML schemas for an XSLT 2.0 SA processor),
            an XML database can use XQuery modules, XSLT stylesheets or any other kind of component,
            etc. But processors include also IDEs, editors, and any program that could want to use
            packaged components and that supports this specification.</p>
         <p>The installed package list is implementation-defined. Each implementation (for a
            specific processor) can define its own way to install and remove packages, as long as it
            properly documents it. A processor should use, when appropriate, the <kw>on-disk
               repository layout</kw> as defined below.</p>
         <p>Whether or not such a repository exists (or several repositories), the implementation
            must define an installed packages list. How this is done is outside the scope of this
            spec. An XML IDE could provide a way to select packages to activate for a specific
            scenario, or a web server container could activate packages on a per-web application
            basis.</p>
         <p>When a reference to a file of a specific kind is done via an absolute URI, a processor
            must look up for this URI in the corresponding URI space in the repository. How the
            repository is set to the processor is implementation-defined (a processor can also use a
            list of repositories, and enable or disable some libraries in any implementation-defined
            way.)</p>
         <p>The URI space to use is defined by the nature of the reference. An XSLT
               <code>href</code> attribute on <code>xsl:import</code> will use the <code>xslt</code>
            URI space, while it will use the <code>xsd</code> space for
               <code>xsl:import-schema</code>.</p>
         <div2 id="pipelines">
            <head>XProc pipelines</head>
            <p>An XProc processor in particular has to pay great attention to the space it uses
               regarding the step that is being evaluated. Any <code>xsl:import</code> instruction
               encountered on the <code>stylesheet</code> port of the step <code>p:xslt</code> has
               to be looked for in the <code>xslt</code> space (regardless if the stylesheet
               document is inlined in the pipeline, computed, loaded from the file system or
               retrieved from the Internet, or if the containing stylesheet has been imported
               itself.)</p>
            <p>The XProc elements <code>p:document</code> and <code>p:data</code>, as well as the
               step <code>p:load</code> are handled specially. They can be used to access any kind
               of resource, including but not limited to components in a repository. The user has to
               tell explicitly the processor what kind of component is looked for by using the
                  <code>pkg:kind</code> extension attribute. For instance, a stylesheet can be
               loaded from a repository as input to the step <code>xslt</code> as following:</p>
            <eg>
&lt;p:xslt>
   &lt;p:input port="stylesheet">
      &lt;p:document href="..." pkg:kind="xslt"/>

         <head>Versioning and dependency management</head>
         <p>Every package has a name (a URI) and a version number. It can also have a set of
            dependencies on other packages, identified by their names. Each dependency can also
            define a specific version (or range of versions) of the package it depends on. In
            addition to depending on other packages, a package can also depend on a specific
            processor (or on one among a set of specifc processors). This section uses the following
            example package to illustrate those concepts:</p>
         <eg>
&lt;package name="http://example.org/app" version="1.0" ...>

   &lt;dependency package="http://external.org/library"/>
   &lt;dependency package="http://partner.com/lib-2" semver="2"/>
   &lt;dependency processor="saxon" version="pe"/>

   &lt;!-- rest of package descriptor skipped -->
   ...

&lt;/package></eg>
         <p>At first glance, we can see that this package (which is named
               <code>http://example.org/app</code> and has the version number <code>1.0</code>),
            depends on the package <code>http://external.org/library</code> (no specific version),
            on the package <code>http://partner.com/lib-2</code> (version 2, whatever minor revision
            numbers) and on the Saxon processor, Professional Edition. The rest of this section
            explains in details the rules behind those dependencies, how to represent them, and
            their semantics.</p>
         <p>The remainder of this section will use the term <emph>primary</emph> for the current
            package, described by this package decriptor, and <emph>secondary</emph> for a package
            it depends on.</p>
         <div2 id="pkgdep">
            <head>Package dependency</head>
            <p>A dependency on another package (usually called a <kw>library</kw>), is represented
               by the element <code>dependency</code>, with an attribute <code>package</code> which
               is the name of the library the package depends on. The dependency can be versioned;
               that is, only some versions of the library are acceptable for this package.</p>
            <p>The versionning attributes are <code>versions</code>, <code>semver</code>,
                  <code>semver-min</code> and <code>semver-max</code>. They are all mutually
               exclusive, except <code>semver-min</code> and <code>semver-max</code>. If no
               versionning attribute is set on the dependency, any version of the secondary package,
               identified by its name (the URI in the <code>package</code> attribute), is
               acceptable. If the <code>versions</code> attribute is used, it defines the exact set
               of acceptable versions for the secondary package, separated by spaces.</p>
            <p>The other versionning attributes use <bibref ref="semver"/> to define the set of
               acceptable versions for the secondary package. We use only the syntax of SemVer, and
               define in addition the format of a SemVer template as being either a SemVer version
               number or a subpart of it (i.e. only the major version, or the major and the minor
               versions, or the major, the minor and the patch version). For instance 1.9 is a valid
               SemVer template (because it does not have any patch number), while 1.9.0 and 1.9.23
               are actual version numbers compatible with this template.</p>
            <p>If the <code>semver</code> attribute is used, the secondary package version must be
               compatible with this template. If <code>semver-min</code> is used, the secondary
               package version must be either compatible with that SemVer template, or greater than
               it. If <code>semver-max</code> is used, the secondary package version must be either
               compatible with that SemVer template, or lower than it. For instance, with
                  <code>semver-min="2.3"</code> and <code>semver-max="3"</code>, any version of the
               secondary package which is equal or above 2.3.0 and strictly below 4.0.0 is valid
               (that is, 2.3.0, 3.0.0, 3.99.87, etc.)</p>
         </div2>
         <div2 id="procdep">
            <head>Processor dependency</head>
            <p>In addition to depending on other packages, a dependency can tell which processor(s)
               is (are) needed for this package:</p>
            <eg><phrase diff="del">&lt;dependency processor="saxon"/></phrase>
<phrase diff="add">&lt;dependency processor="http://saxon.sf.net/he"/></phrase></eg>
            <p>If there is several such dependencies, the package is supported by a specific
               processor as soon as one of the proc dependencies does match. The meaning of the
               versionning attributes on processor dependencies is defined by each processor.</p>
         </div2>
         <div2 id="enforcement">
            <head>Dependency enforcement</head>
            <p>How those rules are enforced is implementation-defined. For instance a command line
               tool to install a package in a repository can generate an error if the required
               dependencies are not installed, try to install them automagically from the web, or
               just emit a warning install the package hoping the dependencies to be installed later
               on, and provide an option to select the behaviour to use. Another implementation can
               enforce the dependencies at compile- or at run-time. An implementation SHOULD provide
               a way to enforce those rules, but can also provide an option to ignore them.</p>
            <p>From the above text, a version number is not defined to have any particular
               semantics, except when used with one of the several SemVer attributes. The only
               constraint is that a version number cannot contain any whitespace character (as
               defined by the <bibref ref="xml"/> recommendation). A library author SHOULD use
               version numbers compatible with SemVer though, unless there is a justification not to
               use it.</p>

      <div1 diff="add" id="resolution">
         <head>URI resolution</head>
         <p>At the end of the day, having packages installed in a repository is interesting only if
            one is able to use the installed components. This can be done by invoking directly the
            component, e.g. an XProc pipeline directly from the command-line or an XSLT stylesheet
            from an IDE, or most of the time by importing the component from within user's own
            components. For instance, a user can import the FunctX XSLT implementation in his/her
            own stylesheet, by refering to it only by its public import URI, provided the FunctX
            package is available to the processor the user uses to evaluate the overall
            transform.</p>
         <p>In order to promote interoperability, this specification defines a standard URI
            resolving mechanism, and how to import installed components from within user's own
            components. In order to stay generic enough though, the initial list of available
            package at runtime, as well as the way to set the initial options of this algorithm, are
            implementation-defined. Indeed, the way to set the available package list will be
            different on an application server and on an IDE, or on a standalone processor and on an
            XML database. The same way, although the algorithm defines a set of options to control
            its behaviour, the way to set those is out of the scope of this specification; a .Net
            API, an IDE and a webapp container, to mention only them, have very different mechanism
            to let the user or developer set options.</p>
         <p>A <kw>public component</kw> is a component which is part of a package, and is associated
            a public import URI within the package descriptor. A public component as a associated
            URI space, as explained earlier. A <kw>universe</kw> is a set of packages available to
            some processor, at some point in time, in some context. As described later, a universe
            can be e.g. the latest version of every packages installed in a specific repository;
            another example is a single package (e.g. used as a web application) and all its
            explicit dependencies, recursively.</p>
         <p>The way to define a universe is implementation-defined, but implementations SHOULD allow
            a user to create a universe from either: a repository or a set of repositories (actually
            choosing the latest version for each package in the repository), or from an explicit set
            of packages, given their names (actually choosing the latest version for each package in
            the list), or from an expicit set of packages, given their names and their version
            numbers (or if no explicit version number is available, choose the latest version for
            the given package). In the two later cases, an implementation SHOULD provide the user
            with the ability of including explicit package dependencies as well, either recursively
            or direct dependencies only. A universe SHOULD NOT contain several packages with the
            same name but different versions. A universe can not contain several packages with the
            same name and the same version number, because in that case their are considered the
            same package regardless they actually are duplicated in the repository (this is the
            responsability of the user to prevent inconsistencies in that case).</p>
         <p>TODO: Define what's a processor, what's compilation, and the case or 'resource'... (that
            is, the context of a resolution)</p>
         <p>When a processor, whilst compiling a component, encounters an import statement, it
            SHOULD perform the following steps:</p>
         <ulist>
            <item>
               <p>if the URI of the imported module is relative or uses the file URI scheme, then

                  appears within a component from a package, it must resolve relatively to that
                  component, according to the original package structure),</p>
            </item>
            <item>
               <p>depending on the context of the import statement, the processor determines the URI

         <head>On-disk repository layout</head>
         <p>This section defines a standard structure for on-disk repositories. An implementation
            can choose not to support this kind of repository and to define its own one (or even to
            not define it publicly, just to provide the ability to install and remove packages, in a
            clearly documented way.) However, there are several advantages to support this
            structure, the most obvious one is to be able to benefit from existing tools to manage
            such repositories as well as existing libraries to access those repositories.</p>
         <p>The repository is a directory on the file system, within which the packages are
            installed. Each package results in a subdirectory in the repository, where the content
            of the XAR file is unzipped. Next to those package directories, there is also a
            subdirectory named <code>.expath-pkg/</code>, which contains administrative information
            about the packages installed in this repository. <phrase diff="del">The package
               directories should be named after the package abbreviation (the <code>abbrev</code>
               attribute in the package descriptor) and the version number, separated by a dash. A
               package directory name must not contain the space character.</phrase></p>
         <note>
            <p diff="add">The package directories SHOULD be named after the package abbreviation
               (the <code>abbrev</code> attribute in the package descriptor) and the version number,
               separated by a dash. A package directory name must not contain the space
               character.</p>
            <p>Because these directory names cannot be ensured to be unique among every packages
               installed in the repository, and because the processors will in some case have to
               translate some characters (depending on the rules of the filesystem they put the
               repository on), they cannot be used as a perfect mapping between package
               abbreviations and directories. It is only described here as a note, in the hope that
               the several implementations will use similar naming strategies, meaningful for
               humans.</p>
         </note>
         <p>The repository maintains a list of installed packages. For each of them, this list
            contains its name (the name URI), its subdirectory name, and its version number. This
            list is maintained within two files: <code>.expath-pkg/packages.xml</code> and
               <code>.expath-pkg/packages.txt</code>. Both contain the same information, the former
            in an XML format and the later as plain text. The XML format looks like the following
            (see <specref ref="packages.xsd"/> for a normative schema):</p>
         <eg>
&lt;packages xmlns="http://expath.org/ns/repo/packages">
   &lt;package name="http://example.org/some/package"
            dir="some-package-2.3"
            version="2.3"/>
   &lt;package name="http://example.com/some-library"
            dir="some-lib-0.1"
            version="0.1"/>
   &lt;package ...
&lt;/packages></eg>
         <p>The text file is a line-separated file (either line termination can be used:
               <code>\r</code>, <code>\n</code> or <code>\n\r</code>, though the standard Internet
            line termination is preferred: <code>\n\r</code>). Each line represent a package, and is
            a space-separated record. The first field is the package directory (the name if the
            subdirectory within the repository where the package has been unzipped), the second one
            is the package name (the name URI), and the last one is the version number. <phrase
               diff="del">The two first fields cannot contain any space character. The version
               number is the only one that can contain a space character (though this is not
               recommended).</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add">No one of those fields can contain any space character.</phrase>
            Every field is separated by exactly one space character (the Unicode character with code
            point #x20). This file then looks like:</p>
         <eg>
some-package-2.3 http://example.org/some/package 2.3
some-lib-0.1 http://example.com/some-library 0.1
...</eg>
         <p>The overall repository thus looks like:</p>
         <eg>
[repository-dir]/
   .expath-pkg/
      packages.txt
      packages.xml
   some-package-2.3/
<phrase diff="del">      query.xq

<phrase diff="del">      ...</phrase>
<phrase diff="add">      expath-pkg.xml
      content/
         ...</phrase></eg>
         <note>
            <p>Because the package descriptor is unzipped in the package directory, as well as the
               rest of the files contained in the package, this is easy to find the mapping between
               package directories and package names and versions: just look into the package
               descriptor into every package directory, and you will find what you are looking for.
               But in order to allow other programs to access easily the list of installed packages,
               we provide the list in <code>.expath-pkg/packages.xml</code>. And because shell
               scripts must be able to access that list as well, a second file, text-oriented, is
               provided; of course this is redundant information, but it is maintained automatically
               by the repository manager, so the redundancy is not an issue.</p>
         </note>
         <p>In addition to this structure, a specific processor can store information in
            subdirectories (both in the repository level or within each package directories),
            provided those directories start with a dot, and are named unambiguously with the name
            of the processor. For instance <code>[repository]/.saxon/</code>
            <phrase diff="add">for repository-wide config for Saxon</phrase>, or
               <code>[repository]/[some-pkg]/.exist/</code>
            <phrase diff="add">for config for eXist for a specific package</phrase>.</p>

         <head>Example</head>
         <p>This section provides a non-normative example to illustrate the concepts defined here.
            Instead of using a <emph>hello world</emph> example, it describes the packaging of the
            existing FunctX library <bibref ref="functx"/>. This library consists of a standard
            XQuery 1.0 library module and a standard XSLT 2.0 stylesheet (both provide the same set
            of functions to either XQuery or XSLT, but this is not relevant to packaging.)</p>
         <p>The first thing to do is to create a ZIP file with both of those components, alongside a
               <emph>package descriptor</emph>. The constraints are: 1) the package descriptor is
            named <code>expath-pkg.xml</code> at the root of the package, <phrase diff="add"
               >and</phrase> 2) the library content is in a directory <phrase diff="add">named
                  <code>content</code></phrase> at the root of the package (aka the <emph><phrase
                  diff="del">package</phrase>
               <phrase diff="add">content</phrase> directory</emph>)<phrase diff="del">, and 3) the
               name of this directory must be the value of the <code>abbrev</code> attribute, and
               must be a valid NCName</phrase>. The structure <phrase diff="del">(the content) of
               the package directory</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add">of the content directory</phrase> is completely free. In our case,
            let's just put both component files directly in the <phrase diff="del">package</phrase>
            <phrase diff="add">content</phrase> directory, and define the module name as
               <code>functx</code>:</p>
         <eg>
expath-pkg.xml
<phrase diff="del">functx/</phrase>
<phrase diff="add">content/</phrase>
   functx.xql
   functx.xsl</eg>
         <p>The XQuery library module's target namespace is defined by the module itself. For the
            XSLT stylesheet, we have to define its <emph>public URI</emph>, used to identify it
            within an <code>xsl:import</code> (or any other means, for instance within XProc or an
            IDE scenarii system). Let's define it as <code>http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl</code>.
            The package descriptor thus looks like the following:</p>
         <eg>
&lt;package xmlns="http://expath.org/ns/pkg"
         spec="1.0"
         name="http://www.functx.com"
         abbrev="functx"
         version="1.0">
   &lt;title>FunctX library&lt;/title>
   &lt;xquery>
      &lt;namespace>http://www.functx.com&lt;/namespace>
      &lt;file>functx.xql&lt;/file>

         <p>We just have to create a ZIP file with this structure and content. The convention is to
            call this file <code>functx-1.0.xar</code> (that is,
               [<emph>abbrev</emph>]-[<emph>version</emph>].xar). That's all for the package itself.
            If the target processor supports the on-disk repository layout, here is what the
            repository could look like after the package has been installed:</p>
         <eg>
[repository-dir]/
   .expath-pkg/
      packages<phrase diff="add">.txt</phrase>
      packages.xml
   functx-1.0/
      expath-pkg.xml
<phrase diff="del">      functx/</phrase>
<phrase diff="add">      content/</phrase>
         functx.xql
         functx.xsl</eg>
         <p>The content of <code>.expath-pkg/packages.xml</code> is:</p>
         <eg>
&lt;packages xmlns="http://expath.org/ns/repo/packages">
   &lt;package name="http://www.functx.com"
            dir="functx-1.0"
            version="1.0"/>
&lt;/packages></eg>
         <p>The content of <code>.expath-pkg/packages.txt</code> is:</p>
         <eg>
functx-1.0 http://www.functx.com 1.0</eg>
         <p>The package directory <code>functx-1.0/</code> has been named after the abbrev and the
            version number. Its content is simply the content of the XAR file, unzipped. A user can
            then import the FunctX library from either an XQuery module or an XSLT stylesheet by
            using respectively an import statement:</p>
         <eg>
import module namespace fx = "http://www.functx.com";</eg>
         <p>or an import instruction:</p>
         <eg>
&lt;xsl:import href="http://www.functx.com/functx.xsl"/></eg>

         <head>Extensibility</head>
         <p>The package format defined in this specification is a complete system to package
            libraries, for the right definition of a library. But a specfic kind of
               <emph>library</emph> can require more information. For instance, a web application is
            also a set of components, but requiring more configuration. An additional descriptor
            format for such applications could be defined and added to this packaging framework to
            define a specialized kind of packages. By building upon this packaging format, the new
            format would benefit from the existing mechanism to map public URIs to components.</p>
         <p>Another extensibility point is the definition of additional component types. The
            component types defined here are the standard types, but an implementation may support
            additional implementation-defined types.</p>
         <p>More generally, an implementation may define any extension element <phrase diff="add">or
               attribute</phrase> in the package descriptor to achieve its purposes, providing that
            the <phrase diff="del">new</phrase> elements <phrase diff="add">and attributes</phrase>
            it defines are neither in the EXPath Packaging namespace nor in the null namespace
               <phrase diff="add">(an attribute on an extension element can be in no namespace, but
               an attribute on a standard element must be in a specific namespace)</phrase>.</p>
